## Achieved Criteria

### Purpose of the outcome

The purpose of this website is to make a booking system for Maunga Club chalets that allows users to book chalets in a functional, aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly way.

### Requirements of end users

The end users of this website are ultimately Maunga Club members or people looking to join. Because of this, I need to make it easy to use and aesthetically pleasing for new users and for existing users I need it to be consistent and convenient.

### Explanation of implications relevant to this website

Because of the requirements of this website, the relevant implications for this website are:

- The website should be aesthetically pleasing to draw in new users.
- The website should be user-friendly and easy to use so that users do not have to spend too much time on the website to find what they need and not be frustrated with the website.
- The website should be consistent and convenient so that users do not have to spend much time on the website to find what they need if they already know what they need.

Because of general requirements for all websites in the industry, other relevant implications for this website are:

- Intellectual property needs to be taken into account when designing the website to avoid infringing on any of the rights of third parties.
- When making the website, I need to make sure that it does not infringe on any legal rights.
- When making the website, I need to take into account privacy and confidentiality.
- The website should be sustainable and future-proof so that it can be easily maintained in the future.

### Demonstration of using tools, techniques and conventions that are appropriate for the purpose and end users of the website

I have demonstrated use of tools appropriate for the purpose of the website by using the following tools:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), used to build the website.
- [React](https://reactjs.org), used to build the website.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), used to deploy the website.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), used to style the website in an efficient way.
- [Tailwind Variants](https://tailwind-variants.org), used to have dark mode in the website.
- [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion), used to animate the website.
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org), used to lint (Code linting is the process of analyzing source code for potential errors, warnings, and best practice violations to improve code quality and readability.) the code.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io), used to format the code.
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), a type safe version of JavaScript, used to write the code.
- [NextUI](https://nextui.org), used to style the website with pre-built components.
- [Embla Carousel](https://embla-carousel.com), used to create a carousel with pre-built components.

I have demonstrated use of techniques appropriate for the purpose of the website by using flex boxes to align elements in an aesthetic way.
Also by using media queries to make the website responsive by using md: before styles that should onlyapply to the website when on a landscape view. More info about md: [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).

I have demonstrated use of conventions appropriate for the purpose of the website by using the following conventions:

- The use of CSS flexbox to align elements in an aesthetic way.
- Because it is a website to be used for a company, it should use the buisness standard software such as using Next.js, React and Vercel to build and deploy the website in an efficient way.
- The use of footer, header and navbar to follow the HTML semantics conventions.

### Evidence of using information I gathered from TESTING to improve the quality of the website

When testing the website with a screen reader, I found that many images did not have alt text. I then added explanetory alt text to all images.
<br/>


(ie to improve what the website looks like and how well it works).

Web testing  checks for
Responsive design (evidence?)
Usability (UX: apply feedback from users)
Accessibility (for people with disabilities) 
Functionality (Do buttons and links all work?)
Content (Check for grammar and spelling errors)

Evidence with https://validator.w3.org/

### Evidence of addressing relevant implications

Make sure that you have addressed these implication, you need to explain HOW they have been addressed.
